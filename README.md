# C# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Practice

## Description
This repository is created to practice and strengthen **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts in C#**.  
It contains hands-on code examples, real-world problem solutions, and diagram-based explanations organized in a **branch-wise structure**.

The focus of this repository is **concept clarity, internal working of OOP, and problem-solving**.
